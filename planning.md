# E-Commerce 
### Stack: MongoDB, Express, React, Node

## Project Summary
The plan is to build a full-stack e-commerce site designated for individuals trying to grow their own brand or sell their own products. It will have a space designated for their social media posts so that the site is more user-relatable and less corporate-feely. 

## User Stories
As a user, when I click onto the seller's link I am greeted by an image which represents the site's tone. 
There is an option to shop now which will take me to view all products organized in a grid. 
The product-list page shows the images, name, and price of each item. 
When I click on the individual product, I am able to view the name, price, and description. I am also able to click "shop now" which takes me to a site whre I can purchase the item.
